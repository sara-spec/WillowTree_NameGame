# WillowTree_NameGame
A company has reached out to WillowTree to take over an existing web app. The client had a nebulous relationship with their previous contractors and the only thing 
we received was the web app’s codebase, a minimal client scope, and a handful of end-to-end tests.
The web app’s name is “Name Game,” a person’s name is displayed along with five pictures of your teammates and you have to match the name with the picture. 
The game is supposed to help you get to know your teammates’ name. The app has a counter for the number of tries, correctly answered questions, and a streak.
